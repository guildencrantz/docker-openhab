# Overview

Docker Image for openHAB 1.7-SNAPSHOT with my personal configurations.

Since there isn't much to configuring openHAB to run in docker this is an all-in-one rather than being built on a base openHAB image.

# Usage

## Docker Registry

This image is not officially registered.

## docker-compose

A container can be controlled with [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), but it won't have a configured openhab.cfg unless you put one in the `configurations` directory:

Run:
`docker-compose up`

Stop:
`docker-compose stop`

I've added `/configurations/openhab.cfg` to `.gitignore` so my suggestion is that when you check out the project you simple hardlink that location to an `openhab.cfg` that lives in a private repository.
